### Project Manifesto and Aim

During the COVID-19 pandemic nearly every aspect of life has been affected. One sector in particular that has caused controversy and unrest is education. 
The decision over schooling has once again turned domestic as children of all ages are made to work at home. 

My aim for the web application is to create a fun, interactive game that encourages cognitive development. Hopefully the contextual story of the game will make it 
more enaging as my goal is to target children between the ages of 9-13. Giving them something still educational but more aligned with how this generation process information.

This game is aimed to help parents too. Keeping the children engaged outside of school work will help eleveate their need to waste valuable work time.

### Player Goals

   - Fun story game to Play
   - Child Friendly characters (Linton)
   - Simple design and big buttons for easy Play
   - Diffiuclty tiers for engaging challenges
   - Visual and Audio rewards during the game
   - Completion banner as reward

### Educational Goals

   - Brain Training using memory receptors 
   - Help with non-verbal reasoning 
   - Linton's rules will be readable for this age group, aid with language learning
   - User name input, help with spelling

### Parental Goals 

   - Easy to use system
   - Child friendly Material
   - Wholesome intrinsic message to help save the world
   - Simple rules 

### Developer and Business Goals

   - Create sprite character for use in follow up games
   - Intuitive and easy design
