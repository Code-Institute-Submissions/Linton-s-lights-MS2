### Project Manifesto and Aim

During the COVID-19 pandemic nearly every aspect of life has been affected. One sector in particular that has caused controversy and unrest is education. 
The decision over schooling has once again turned domestic as children of all ages are made to work at home. 

My aim for the web application is to create a fun, interactive game that encourages cognitive development. Hopefully the contextual story of the game will make it 
more enaging as my goal is to target children between the ages of 9-13. Giving them something still educational but more aligned with how this generation process information.

This game is aimed to help parents too. Keeping the children engaged outside of school work will help eleveate their need to waste valuable work time.
